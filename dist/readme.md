## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS pre-processor SASS
- Flexbox
- desk-first workflow

### What I learned

I enjoyed this challenge alot. From how to structure the page to styling. Came across a difficult section which was the hovering of the image, took a couple of tries but came out unsuccessful. But was able to overcome that part with the help of some research. It did take a while but happy with how it came out. 

### Continued development

I`d like to focus more on the CSS, given that this challenge was in HTML and CSS. Still need to wrap my head around with positions.

### Useful resources

- [hovering image overlay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bGbykdR4T8&t=1578s) - Watching this helped with the image hover.
